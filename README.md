# runj

runj is an experimental, proof-of-concept
[OCI](https://opencontainers.org)-compatible runtime for FreeBSD jails.

> **Important**: runj is a proof-of-concept and the implementation has not been
> evaluated for its security.  Do not use runj on a production system.  Do not
> run workloads inside runj that rely on a secure configuration.  This is a
> personal project, not backed by the author's employer.

## Status

runj is in early development and is functional, but has very limited features.

runj currently supports the following parts of the OCI runtime spec:

* Commands
  - Create
  - Delete
  - Start
  - State
  - Kill
* Config
  - Root path
  - Process args
  - Process environment
  - Process terminal

## Getting started

### OCI bundle

To run a jail with runj, you must prepare an OCI bundle.  Bundles consist of a
root filesystem and a JSON-formatted configuration file.

#### Root filesystem

The root filesystem can consist either of a regular FreeBSD userland or a
reduced set of FreeBSD-compatible programs.  For experimentation, 
statically-linked programs from `/recovery` may be copied into your bundle.  You
can obtain a regular FreeBSD userland suitable for use with runj from
`https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/$ARCH/$VERSION/base.txz` (where
`$ARCH` and `$VERSION` are replaced by your architecture and desired version
respectively).  Several `demo` convenience commands have been provided in runj
to assist in experimentation; you can use `runj demo download` to retrieve a
working root filesystem from the FreeBSD website.

#### Config

`runj` supports a limited number of configuration parameters for jails.
The OCI runtime spec does not currently include support for FreeBSD.  As this
proof-of-concept is developed, FreeBSD-related configuration parameters can be
added to the upstream specification.  For now, the extensions are documented
[here](docs/oci.md)

You can use `runj demo spec` to generate an example config file for your bundle.

Once you have a config file, edit the root path and process args to your desired
values.

#### Lifecycle

Create a container with `runj create $ID $BUNDLE` where `$ID` is the identifier
you picked for your container and `$BUNDLE` is the bundle directory with a valid
`config.json`.

Start your container with `runj start $ID`.  The process defined in the
`config.json` will be started.

Inspect the state of your container with `runj state $ID`.

Send a signal to your container process (or all processes in the container) with
`runj kill $ID`.

Remove your container with `runj delete $ID`.

### containerd

Along with the main `runj` OCI runtime, this repository also contains an
experimental shim that can be used with containerd.  The shim is available as
`containerd-shim-runj-v1` and can be used from the `ctr` command-line tool by
specifying `--runtime wtf.sbk.runj.v1`.

A bleeding-edge build of containerd is currently required as not all the
necessary patches for FreeBSD support are available in a release.  You can find
the necessary commits in the
[`master` branch of containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/tree/master).

#### OCI Image

A base OCI image for FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE on the `amd64` architecture is
available in the
[Amazon ECR public gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/samuelkarp/freebsd).  You
can pull the image with the `ctr` tool like this:

```
$ sudo ctr image pull public.ecr.aws/samuelkarp/freebsd:12.1-RELEASE
```

If you prefer to build your own image, need an image for a different
architecture, or want to try out a different version of FreeBSD, `runj` contains
a utility that can convert a FreeBSD root filesystem into an OCI image.  You
can download, convert, and import an image as follows:

```
$ runj demo download --output rootfs.txz
Found arch:  amd64
Found version:  12.1-RELEASE

```

#### Running containers with `ctr`

With containerd, `runj`, and the `containerd-shim-runj-v1` binary installed, you
can use the `ctr` command-line tool to run containers like this:

```
$ sudo ctr run \
    --runtime wtf.sbk.runj.v1 \
    --rm \
    public.ecr.aws/samuelkarp/freebsd:12.1-RELEASE \
    my-container \
    sh -c 'echo "Hello from the container!"'
Hello from the container!
```

## Implementation details

runj uses FreeBSD's userland utilities for managing jails; it does not directly
invoke the jail-related syscalls.  You must have working versions of `jail(8)`,
`jls(8)`, `jexec(8)`, and `ps(1)` installed on your system.  `runj kill` makes
use of the `kill(1)` command inside the jail's rootfs; if this command does not
exist (or is not functional), `runj kill` will not work.

## Future

Resource limits on FreeBSD can be configured using the kernel's RCTL interface.
runj does not currently use this, but may add support for it via `rctl(8)` in
the future.
